## Diagonal Difference

<https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-week-preparation-kit-diagonal-difference/>

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9

The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .

### Function description
diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:
- int `arr[n][m]`: an array of integers

Return
`int`: the absolute diagonal difference


Constraints
- `-100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100`

### Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
