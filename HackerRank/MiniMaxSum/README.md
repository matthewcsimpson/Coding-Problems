## Mini-Max Sum

<https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-week-preparation-kit-mini-max-sum/>

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be
calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective
minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### Example
-   `arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
- Mimimum sum is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16`
- Maximum sum is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`


### Function Description
miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):
-   `arr`: an array of  integers

### Input Format
A single line of five space-separated integers.

### Constraints

-   `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

Hints: Beware of integer overflow! Use 64-bit Integer.
