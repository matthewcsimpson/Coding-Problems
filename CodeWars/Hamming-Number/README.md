A Hamming number is a positive integer of the form 2^i _ 3^j _ 5^k, for some non-negative integers i, j, and k.

Write a function that computes the nth smallest Hamming number.

Specifically:

The first smallest Hamming number is 1 = 2^0 _ 3^0 _ 5^0
The second smallest Hamming number is 2 = 2^1 _ 3^0 _ 5^0
The third smallest Hamming number is 3 = 2^0 _ 3^1 _ 5^0
The fourth smallest Hamming number is 4 = 2^2 _ 3^0 _ 5^0
The fifth smallest Hamming number is 5 = 2^0 _ 3^0 _ 5^1
