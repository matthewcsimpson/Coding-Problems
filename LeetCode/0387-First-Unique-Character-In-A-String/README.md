## 0387 - First Unique Char in a String

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

### Example 1:

- Input: `s = "leetcode"`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: _The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index._

### Example 2:

- Input: `s = "loveleetcode"`
- Output: `2`

### Example 3:

- Input: `s = "aabb"`
- Output: `-1`
- Explanation: _There are no unique characters._

### Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
