## 367 Valid Perfect Square

Given a positive integer `num`, return `true` if `num` is a perfect square or false otherwise.

_A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself._

_You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt._

### Example 1:

- Input: `num = 16`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: _We return true because 4 \* 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer._

### Example 2:

- Input: `num = 14`
- Output: `false`
- _Explanation: We return false because 3.742 \* 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer._

### Constraints:

- `1 <= num <= 231 - 1`
