## 9. Palindrome Number

[LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### Example 1:
-   Input: `x = 121`
-   Output: `true`
-   _Explanation: `121` reads as `121` from left to right and from right to left._

### Example 2:
-   Input: `x = -121`
-   Output: `false`
-   _Explanation: From left to right, it reads `-121`. From right to left, it becomes `121-`. Therefore it is not a palindrome._

### Example 3:
-   Input: `x = 10`
-   Output: `false`
-   _Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome._

### Constraints:
-   `-231 <= x <= 231 - 1`
