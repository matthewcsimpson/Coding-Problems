[LeeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
-   Input: `s = "abcabcbb"`
-   Output: `3`
-   _Explanation: The answer is "`abc`", with the length of `3`._

### Example 2:
-   Input: `s = "bbbbb"`
-   Output: `1`
-   _Explanation: The answer is "`b`", with the length of `1`._

### Example 3:
-   Input: `s = "pwwkew"`
-   Output: `3`
-   _Explanation: The answer is "`wke`", with the length of `3`._

_Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring._

### Constraints:
-   `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
-   `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
